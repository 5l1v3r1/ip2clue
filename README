. About
This software product provides access to multiple IP databases (Maxmind,
Software 77, Webhosting.info and ip2location) to retrieve IP information
(country short, country long etc.).
It has a daemon that supports lots of concurrent connections thanks to Conn
library (also at http://kernel.embedromix.ro/us/), and a client binary.
Also, some client examples are provided (PHP, C etc.).

Databases supported:
- http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/ (format 'webhosting')
- http://software77.net/ (format 'software77')
- http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry - both IPv4 and IPv6 (formats
'maxmind' and 'maxmind-v6')
- http://www.ip2location.com/ (format 'ip2location')


. Configuration
- Edit /etc/ip2clue/download.conf to start automatically download the data.
- Edit /etc/ip2clue/ip2clued.conf to configure IPv4/IPv6 support, port etc.


. Running & operations
- Start the ip2clued daemon (service ip2clued start, for example).
- Connect to it with "telnet localhost 9999" and type "S" and Enter:
statistics will be displayed. Depending on databases sizes, will take some time
for the daemon to return data.
- To test it, connect to it as above and issue command "R193.193.193.193" and
then press Enter: Something like "OK ip=193.193.193.193 cs=UA cl= tz= isp="
will appear.

(loopback network, IPv4), it achived more than 10.000 requests per second.
